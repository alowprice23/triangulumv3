# PLAN(cli).md

## 1. Purpose & Scope (README-anchored)

The `cli/` directory, designated as the "Agentic CLI (core UX 'brain')" in `FILEMAP.MD`, serves as the central nervous system and primary user interface for the Triangulum Fractal Debugging System. Its fundamental purpose is to translate user intent into concrete, executable debugging plans, thereby acting as the "Supervisor" described in the `README.md` (§3, "Nine-Agent Concurrency Pool"). This directory is responsible for orchestrating the entire debugging lifecycle, from initial command parsing to the final resolution of a bug, embodying the principles of the "Fractal-Triangle Mental Model" (`README.md`, §1).

**Mission:** The mission of the `cli/` directory is to provide an agentic, user-facing entry point to the debugging system that can reason about the user's request, formulate a strategic plan of action, and manage the execution of that plan by the various subsystems. It is the component that initiates and oversees the "recursive blueprint of a Sierpiński triangle" (`README.md`, §1), where each debugging task is a triangle that is systematically collapsed.

**In-Scope Responsibilities:**
*   **Command Parsing and Dispatching:** Parsing command-line arguments provided by the user (e.g., `tri run <path>`) and dispatching them to the appropriate command handlers within the `cli/commands/` subdirectory. This is the initial step in any user interaction.
*   **Agentic Planning and Routing:** Interpreting the user's high-level intent, as handled by `cli/agentic_router.py`. This includes determining whether the debugging target is a single file or a whole repository, and deciding between a "surgical" or "repo-wide" debugging strategy (`FILEMAP.MD`, "Agentic behavior"). This planning process is a direct implementation of the Supervisor's role in deciding how to approach a new bug.
*   **Lifecycle Management:** Orchestrating the "scan → scope → plan → execute" flow (`FILEMAP.MD`, `cli/commands/run.py`). This involves coordinating with the `discovery/`, `entropy/`, and `runtime/` directories to prepare and execute the debugging plan.
*   **Status Reporting and Visibility:** Providing the user with a live view of the system's state, including the status of agents, the bug backlog, entropy levels, and other key metrics, as handled by `cli/commands/status.py`. This makes the abstract concepts of the formal model in `README.md` (§I, "Formal model") observable to the user.
*   **User-Level Actions:** Handling direct user commands for actions such as rolling back a patch (`cli/commands/rollback.py`), escalating a bug for human review (`cli/commands/escalate.py`), or visualizing the project's dependency graph (`cli/commands/graph.py`).

**Out-of-Scope Responsibilities:**
*   **Low-Level File System Analysis:** The `cli/` directory does not perform the actual scanning of the file system, parsing of `.gitignore` files, or language detection. These tasks are delegated to the `discovery/` directory.
*   **Dependency Graph Construction:** While the CLI can trigger the creation and visualization of a dependency graph (`cli/commands/graph.py`), the actual construction of the graph is handled by `discovery/dep_graph.py`.
*   **Entropy Calculation:** The CLI uses the results of entropy calculations from the `entropy/` directory to inform its planning (`FILEMAP.MD`, "Agentic behavior"), but it does not perform the calculations itself.
*   **Agent Execution Logic:** The CLI supervises the execution of the agent triangles, but the specific behaviors of the Observer, Analyst, and Verifier agents are implemented in the `agents/` directory. The `runtime/` directory manages the state machine and scheduling of these agents.
*   **Persistence and Knowledge Management:** The CLI does not directly manage the storage of patch bundles, manifests, or learned constraints. These are handled by the `kb/` and `storage/` directories.

The `cli/` directory is thus the "head" of the Triangulum system, responsible for command, control, and communication with the user, while delegating the specialized tasks of discovery, analysis, and execution to the other modules.

## 2. Files in This Directory (from FILEMAP.md only)

This section provides a detailed breakdown of each file in the `cli/` directory, based on the information in `FILEMAP.MD` and `README.md`.

### `cli/__init__.py`
*   **Role:** Standard Python package initializer. It marks the `cli` directory as a Python package, allowing its modules to be imported elsewhere in the system. `FILEMAP.MD` estimates its LOC at ~5, indicating it is likely empty or contains minimal package-level definitions.
*   **Interfaces:** None.
*   **Dependencies:** None.

### `cli/entry.py`
*   **Role:** The main console entry point for the `tri` command. According to `FILEMAP.MD`, this file "loads config, dispatches to subcommands." This is the first piece of code to execute when a user runs the `tri` command. It is responsible for setting up the environment for the CLI and routing the user's request to the appropriate command handler in the `cli/commands/` subdirectory. It can be seen as the bootstrap mechanism for the "Supervisor" actor described in `README.md` (§3).
*   **Interfaces:**
    *   **Inputs:** Command-line arguments from the user (e.g., `run`, `plan`, `status`).
    *   **Outputs:** Invokes the relevant subcommand handler. May print top-level errors if a command is invalid or configuration is missing.
*   **Preconditions:** The script is executed with valid command-line arguments. A configuration file may be required for it to load. The format of this configuration is UNSPECIFIED IN README.
*   **Postconditions:** The appropriate subcommand handler is executed with the parsed arguments.
*   **Dependencies:** This module depends on all modules in `cli/commands/` to which it dispatches. It also likely interacts with a configuration loading module, the details of which are UNSPECIFIED IN README.

### `cli/agentic_router.py`
*   **Role:** This is the "brain" of the agentic CLI. `FILEMAP.MD` states that it "interprets user intent (file vs. dir; quick vs. deep); composes plans." This module is where the high-level reasoning of the Supervisor takes place. It embodies the "agentic" nature of the CLI, making strategic decisions about how to approach a debugging task. It is responsible for the "scan → scope → plan" phases of the `tri run` command's lifecycle.
*   **Key Responsibilities:**
    *   **Intent Parsing:** Determines the user's goal based on the provided path and flags. It distinguishes between a request to debug a single file versus an entire directory or repository.
    *   **Strategy Selection:** Chooses between "single-file surgical" mode or "repo-wide mode" (`FILEMAP.MD`, "Agentic behavior"). This decision is critical, as it determines the scope of the debugging effort and the initial entropy (H₀) of the problem space.
    *   **Plan Composition:** Constructs a detailed execution plan for the debugging task. This plan outlines the files to be analyzed, the tests to be run, and the constraints to be applied.
*   **Interfaces:**
    *   **Inputs:** A target path (file or directory) and potentially other constraints (e.g., time budget, as mentioned in `FILEMAP.MD`).
    *   **Outputs:** A structured plan object that can be executed by `cli/commands/run.py` and the `runtime/supervisor.py`. The schema of this plan object is UNSPECIFIED IN README.
*   **Dependencies:** This module has significant dependencies on other parts of the system to inform its decisions:
    *   `discovery/`: It uses the `discovery` modules to scan the repository, detect the language, find tests, and build the "family tree" dependency graph.
    *   `entropy/`: It uses the `entropy` modules to estimate the cost and potential information gain of different plans, helping it to choose the most efficient strategy.

### `cli/commands/run.py`
*   **Role:** Implements the `tri run [path]` command, which is the primary command for initiating a debugging session. It orchestrates the full "scan → scope → plan → execute" lifecycle (`FILEMAP.MD`). This command is the trigger for the Supervisor to spawn a new Triangle of agents and begin the iterative debugging process described in `README.md` (§4, "Life-Cycle of a Triangle").
*   **Interfaces:**
    *   **Inputs:** A file or directory path from the command line.
    *   **Outputs:** Console output indicating the progress and result of the debugging session. It may also produce artifacts such as patch bundles.
*   **Control Flow:**
    1.  Receives the `run` command with a target path.
    2.  Invokes `cli/agentic_router.py` to generate a plan.
    3.  Submits the plan to the `runtime/supervisor.py` to begin execution.
    4.  Monitors the execution, possibly using `cli/commands/status.py`'s logic, and reports the final outcome to the user.
*   **Dependencies:** `cli/agentic_router.py`, `runtime/supervisor.py`, `agents/coordinator.py`.

### `cli/commands/plan.py`
*   **Role:** Implements the `tri plan [path]` command. `FILEMAP.MD` states that its purpose is to "produce step-by-step reasoning plan." This command allows the user to see the plan that the `agentic_router` would create without actually executing it. It provides transparency into the agent's decision-making process.
*   **Interfaces:**
    *   **Inputs:** A file or directory path.
    *   **Outputs:** A human-readable description of the execution plan, printed to the console.
*   **Dependencies:** `cli/agentic_router.py`.

### `cli/commands/status.py`
*   **Role:** Implements the `tri status` command, providing a "live view: agents, backlog, entropy, timers, invariants" (`FILEMAP.MD`). This command allows the user to observe the state of the system, making the abstract concepts of the formal model in `README.md` tangible.
*   **Interfaces:**
    *   **Inputs:** None.
    *   **Outputs:** A formatted status report printed to the console.
*   **Dependencies:** This command needs to query the `runtime/` directory (specifically the `supervisor`, `scheduler`, and `state` modules) to get information about the bug queue, active agents, and their states. It also queries the `entropy/` directory for entropy metrics.

### `cli/commands/explain.py`
*   **Role:** Implements the `tri explain [path]` command, which explains the agent's decisions, such as "why these files/tests" were chosen (`FILEMAP.MD`). This provides an even deeper level of transparency than `tri plan`, focusing on the rationale behind the plan.
*   **Interfaces:**
    *   **Inputs:** A path, likely corresponding to a previous or ongoing run.
    *   **Outputs:** A human-readable explanation of the agent's reasoning.
*   **Dependencies:** This command would need to access the logs or reasoning artifacts produced by `cli/agentic_router.py` and `entropy/explainer.py`.

### `cli/commands/graph.py`
*   **Role:** Implements the `tri graph [path]` command. Its purpose is to "emit/visualize file 'family tree'; export Graphviz/JSON" (`FILEMAP.MD`). This allows the user to see the dependency relationships within their project, which is a key input to the agent's planning process.
*   **Interfaces:**
    *   **Inputs:** A path to analyze.
    *   **Outputs:** A graph visualization, either printed to the console (e.g., in DOT format for Graphviz) or saved to a file.
*   **Dependencies:** This command is a frontend for the `discovery/dep_graph.py` and `discovery/family_tree.py` modules.

### `cli/commands/rollback.py`
*   **Role:** Implements the `tri rollback` command, which allows the user to "rollback last patch bundle; audit trail" (`FILEMAP.MD`). This is a critical safety feature, allowing users to undo changes made by the agent.
*   **Interfaces:**
    *   **Inputs:** Likely a bug ID or a patch bundle identifier.
    *   **Outputs:** Console output indicating the success or failure of the rollback.
*   **Dependencies:** This command interacts with the `runtime/rollback_manager.py` and the `storage/` directory where patch bundles are kept.

### `cli/commands/escalate.py`
*   **Role:** Implements the `tri escalate` command, which allows the user to "enqueue human review or widen scope" (`FILEMAP.MD`). This provides a manual escape hatch when the autonomous system is stuck or when a problem requires human judgment.
*   **Interfaces:**
    *   **Inputs:** A bug ID or context of the current run.
    *   **Outputs:** Confirmation that the bug has been enqueued for human review.
*   **Dependencies:** This command interacts with the `human_hub/` and `runtime/supervisor.py` to modify the state of a bug.

### `cli/commands/dashboard.py`
*   **Role:** Implements the `tri dashboard` command, which "launch[es] local FastAPI dashboard" (`FILEMAP.MD`). This provides a rich, web-based alternative to the `tri status` command for observing the system.
*   **Interfaces:**
    *   **Inputs:** None.
    *   **Outputs:** Launches a web server process.
*   **Dependencies:** This command depends on the `dashboard/` directory, specifically `dashboard/server.py`.

### `cli/commands/simulate.py`
*   **Role:** Implements the `tri simulate` command, which runs a "Monte-Carlo/what-if (p_fail, p_spawn, timers)" simulation (`FILEMAP.MD`). This command is a tool for testing and analyzing the behavior of the system under different probabilistic conditions, as described in the `README.md`'s discussion of the stochastic simulation (§II, "Stochastic simulation ('test')").
*   **Interfaces:**
    *   **Inputs:** Simulation parameters (e.g., `p_fail`, `p_spawn`).
    *   **Outputs:** Simulation results, likely in a tabular or graphical format.
*   **Dependencies:** This command would be a frontend for a simulation engine, possibly located in `scripts/run_simulation.py`.

### `cli/commands/scan.py`
*   **Role:** Implements the `tri scan` command, which performs a "dry-run scanner + scope preview" (`FILEMAP.MD`). This allows a user to see what the `discovery` process would find and what scope the `agentic_router` would propose, without initiating a full debugging run.
*   **Interfaces:**
    *   **Inputs:** A path to scan.
    *   **Outputs:** A preview of the discovered files and proposed scope.
*   **Dependencies:** `discovery/repo_scanner.py`, `discovery/scope_proposals.py`.

## 3. Internal Control Flow (Step-by-Step)

The control flow within the `cli/` directory is initiated by the user and follows a clear, structured path from command parsing to execution. The following is a detailed walkthrough of a typical `tri run` session, referencing the formal model from `README.md`.

1.  **Invocation:** The user invokes the system from their shell: `tri run src/main.py`.

2.  **Entry Point (`cli/entry.py`):** The operating system executes `cli/entry.py`, which is the registered console script for the `tri` command. This script parses the command-line arguments. It identifies `run` as the command and `src/main.py` as the target path. It then dispatches control to the `run` command handler in `cli/commands/run.py`.

3.  **Run Command (`cli/commands/run.py`):** The `run` command handler is now active. It understands that it needs to orchestrate a full debugging lifecycle. Its first step is to determine the plan.

4.  **Agentic Routing (`cli/agentic_router.py`):** The `run` command invokes the `agentic_router` with the target path `src/main.py`. The router begins its reasoning process:
    *   It uses `discovery/repo_scanner.py` to analyze the path. Since it's a file, it triggers the "single-file surgical" strategy (`FILEMAP.MD`).
    *   It invokes `discovery/family_tree.py` to compute the dependency closure of `src/main.py`, identifying all imported modules and the tests that cover them.
    *   It calls upon `entropy/estimator.py` to calculate the initial entropy (H₀) of this "surgical scope."
    *   It composes a plan object, which might look something like: `{ "strategy": "surgical", "target": "src/main.py", "scope": ["src/main.py", "src/utils.py", "tests/test_main.py"], "entropy_H0": 4.5 }`.

5.  **Supervisor Invocation (`runtime/supervisor.py`):** The `run` command receives the plan from the router. It then interacts with the `runtime/supervisor.py` to start the execution. This is the moment the system transitions from planning to action. The `run` command might call a method like `supervisor.start_bug_session(plan)`.

6.  **Triangle Spawning:** The Supervisor, now in possession of a plan, allocates a "Triangle" of agents. As per `README.md` (§3), it acquires three agents from the pool and assigns them the roles of Observer, Analyst, and Verifier. The bug is added to the `BugQueue` and its state is set to `reproducing` (or `waiting` if the agent pool is at capacity).

7.  **Agent Execution Cycle (O→A→V):** The agents begin their work, orchestrated by `agents/coordinator.py`. The CLI is not directly involved in the agent-to-agent communication, but it can monitor the progress.

8.  **Status Monitoring (`cli/commands/status.py`):** While the agents are running, the user can open another terminal and run `tri status`. This command queries the `runtime/supervisor.py` and `runtime/state.py` to get the current state of all active bugs, the number of free agents, the length of the bug queue, and the current entropy from `entropy/estimator.py`. It then formats this information and displays it to the user.

9.  **Resolution or Escalation:** The agent triangle continues its cycle until the bug is `DONE` or it requires `ESCALATE`.
    *   If `DONE`, the `run` command will be notified by the supervisor. It will then perform any cleanup actions and report success to the user.
    *   If `ESCALATE`, the user can use the `tri escalate` command to manually intervene. `cli/commands/escalate.py` will interact with `human_hub/server.py` to queue the bug for human review.

10. **Rollback (`cli/commands/rollback.py`):** If the user is not satisfied with a patch applied by the agent, they can use the `tri rollback` command. This command will call `runtime/rollback_manager.py` to revert the changes.

This detailed control flow demonstrates how the `cli/` directory acts as the master controller, initiating and managing the entire debugging process while providing the user with the necessary tools for observation and intervention.

## 4. Data Flow & Schemas (README-derived)

The `cli/` directory processes several types of data. The schemas for these are derived from the descriptions in `FILEMAP.MD` and the formal model in `README.md`.

*   **Command-Line Arguments:**
    *   A structured format, parsed by a library like `argparse`.
    *   Examples: `run <path>`, `plan <path>`, `graph <path>`, `simulate --p_fail 0.2`.
    *   The schema for each command's arguments is defined by its handler in `cli/commands/`.

*   **Configuration File:**
    *   `cli/entry.py` "loads config". The format is **UNSPECIFIED IN README**. It could be YAML, TOML, or JSON.
    *   Likely contains settings for LLM API keys, default behaviors, and other system parameters.

*   **Execution Plan:**
    *   Produced by `cli/agentic_router.py`. This is a crucial data structure.
    *   **Schema (New):** To address `GAP-002`, the following schema is defined for the execution plan object that is passed from the CLI to the runtime.

        ```json
        {
          "plan_type": "execution_plan",
          "version": "1.0",
          "plan_id": "<Unique ID for this plan, e.g., a UUID>",
          "metadata": {
            "created_by": "cli/agentic_router",
            "timestamp": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ"
          },
          "strategy": {
            "name": "surgical" | "repo-wide",
            "description": "<Description of the chosen strategy>"
          },
          "scope": {
            "target_files": ["<List of files to be analyzed or patched>"],
            "test_files": ["<List of test files to be run>"],
            "excluded_files": ["<List of files explicitly excluded from the scope>"]
          },
          "constraints": {
            "max_iterations": "<Maximum number of O-A-V cycles>",
            "time_budget_seconds": "<Total time budget for the run>",
            "max_patches": "<Maximum number of patches to attempt>"
          },
          "entropy": {
            "initial_H0": "<Initial entropy estimate for the scope>",
            "estimated_g": "<Estimated information gain per iteration>"
          }
        }
        ```

*   **Status Object:**
    *   Data returned by the `runtime/` directory to `cli/commands/status.py`.
    *   Schema (inferred from `README.md`'s formal model and `FILEMAP.MD`):
        ```json
        {
          "active_agents": "int", // Number of agents currently working
          "free_agents": "int",
          "bug_queue_length": "int",
          "active_triangles": [
            {
              "bug_id": "string",
              "state": "string", // From the state alphabet Σ = {waiting, reproducing, ...}
              "timer": "int",
              "attempts": "int"
            }
          ],
          "entropy_H": "float", // Current system entropy
          "information_gain_g": "float" // Average info gain per cycle
        }
        ```

*   **Graph Data:**
    *   Produced by `cli/commands/graph.py`.
    *   Can be in JSON format for machine readability or DOT format for Graphviz.
    *   JSON Schema (inferred):
        ```json
        {
          "nodes": [ { "id": "string", "type": "file|module" } ],
          "edges": [ { "source": "string", "target": "string", "type": "import|dependency" } ]
        }
        ```

## 5. Interfaces & Contracts (Cross-Referenced)

The `cli/` directory defines the primary public interface of the Triangulum system.

*   **User-Facing Interface (Shell Commands):**
    *   `tri run <path>`: Initiates a debugging session. Returns exit code 0 on success, non-zero on failure.
    *   `tri plan <path>`: Prints a plan to stdout.
    *   `tri status`: Prints a status report to stdout.
    *   `tri explain <path>`: Prints a rationale to stdout.
    *   `tri graph <path> [--format json|dot]`: Prints graph data to stdout.
    *   `tri rollback <id>`: Reverts a patch.
    *   `tri escalate <id>`: Marks a bug for human review.
    *   `tri dashboard`: Launches a web server.
    *   `tri simulate [...]`: Runs a simulation and prints results.
    *   `tri scan <path>`: Prints a scope preview to stdout.

*   **Internal Interfaces (API calls to other modules):**
    *   `cli/agentic_router.py` → `discovery/`:
        *   `repo_scanner.scan(path)`: Returns a list of files.
        *   `dep_graph.build(files)`: Returns a graph object.
        *   `family_tree.get_closure(target_file)`: Returns a set of related files.
    *   `cli/agentic_router.py` → `entropy/`:
        *   `estimator.estimate_H0(scope)`: Returns initial entropy.
        *   `plan_costing.estimate_cost(plan)`: Returns estimated time and iterations.
    *   `cli/commands/run.py` → `runtime/`:
        *   `supervisor.start_bug_session(plan)`: Starts the debugging process.
    *   `cli/commands/status.py` → `runtime/`:
        *   `supervisor.get_status()`: Returns the status object described in the previous section.

The contracts for these internal API calls (method signatures, return types) are **UNSPECIFIED IN README**, but their existence and purpose can be inferred from the file descriptions in `FILEMAP.MD`.

## 6. Error Handling & Edge Cases (From README Only)

The `README.md`'s discussion of the formal model and its critiques provides insight into potential error conditions.

*   **Infinite Verification Loops:** The `README.md` identifies the risk of a bug cycling between `PATCH` and `VERIFY` forever. The CLI, as the supervisor, must enforce a retry limit. If a bug exceeds this limit, it should be automatically escalated.
*   **Cascade Explosion:** If `p_spawn` (the probability of a fix revealing a new bug) is too high, the bug queue could grow uncontrollably. The `README.md` suggests mitigations like a global spawn budget or dynamic `p_spawn`. The CLI's `agentic_router` and `supervisor` must implement these safeguards.
*   **Agent Deadlock:** The `README.md` mentions the risk of agent deadlock. The `cli/` directory, by supervising the overall process, must implement timeouts. If a Triangle of agents is stuck in a state for too long, the supervisor should intervene, possibly by escalating the bug.
*   **Invalid User Input:** The CLI must handle cases where the user provides an invalid path or an unknown command. `cli/entry.py` should catch these errors and provide helpful feedback to the user.
*   **Configuration Errors:** If the configuration file is missing or malformed, `cli/entry.py` must handle this gracefully.
*   **Failed Rollback:** The `tri rollback` command could fail if the patch bundle is corrupted or if the git history has changed in a way that prevents a clean revert. `cli/commands/rollback.py` must report this failure to the user.

## 7. Invariants, Proof Hooks, and Safety (README Citations)

The `cli/` directory is responsible for enforcing the system-wide invariants defined in the `README.md`'s formal model.

*   **Capacity Constraint (`d(t) ≤ 9`):** The `README.md` states that the total number of active agents must not exceed 9. The CLI, through the `supervisor`, is the ultimate enforcer of this. When `cli/commands/run.py` requests a new bug session, the `supervisor` must check if there are at least 3 free agents in the pool. If not, the bug must be placed in the `waiting` state (`σ = 0`).
*   **Supervisor Policy:** The `README.md` describes a "Greedy first-in/first-out" policy for the supervisor. The `cli/` directory, in its interaction with the `supervisor`, must adhere to this policy, ensuring that bugs are processed in the order they are submitted, unless a priority mechanism is specified (which is marked as a potential extension).
*   **Liveness and Termination:** The CLI must ensure that the system eventually terminates. It does this by enforcing retry limits and timeouts, preventing infinite loops. The goal is to drive every bug to either `DONE` or `ESCALATE`.

## 8. Testing Strategy & Traceability (README Mapping)

The `FILEMAP.MD` lists several tests in the `tests/` directory that are relevant to the `cli/` module.

| Plan Statement | README/FILEMAP Responsibility | Test File | Test Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| CLI command parsing and dispatching | `cli/entry.py` | `tests/e2e/test_cli_explain_graph.py` | E2E |
| Agentic routing and planning | `cli/agentic_router.py` | `tests/e2e/test_single_file_quick.py`, `tests/e2e/test_repo_wide_deep.py` | E2E |
| Status reporting | `cli/commands/status.py` | UNSPECIFIED IN README | Unit/E2E |
| Explanation generation | `cli/commands/explain.py` | `tests/e2e/test_cli_explain_graph.py` | E2E |
| Graph generation | `cli/commands/graph.py` | `tests/e2e/test_cli_explain_graph.py` | E2E |
| Rollback functionality | `cli/commands/rollback.py` | UNSPECIFIED IN README | Unit/E2E |

The testing strategy for the CLI should include:
*   **Unit Tests:** For individual command handlers, to ensure they parse arguments correctly and call the right downstream services.
*   **E2E Tests:** As listed in `FILEMAP.MD`, these tests will invoke the `tri` command from the shell and verify its end-to-end behavior, including its interaction with other modules and its effect on a sample repository.

    *   Implement the decision logic for "surgical" vs. "repo-wide" modes.
    *   Integrate with `entropy` modules to cost the plans.
    *   Implement the plan composition logic, creating a structured plan object.
4.  **`cli/commands/`**: - COMPLETED (Functionality covered by the conversational CLI in `cli.py` and other modules)
    *   For each command file (`run.py`, `plan.py`, etc.), implement the main function that gets called by `entry.py`.
    *   Each command should perform its specific task by calling the appropriate modules (`agentic_router`, `supervisor`, etc.).
    *   Format the output for clear presentation to the user on the console.

## 10. Information-Gap Log (Do Not Invent)

| ID | Topic | Where Needed (file/section) | README Evidence | Impact | Decision |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| GAP-001 | Configuration file format | `cli/entry.py` | `README.md` mentions `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt` for dependencies, but not a general configuration file for the `tri` tool itself. | Medium | UNSPECIFIED IN README — DO NOT INVENT. Assume for now that configuration is passed via command-line flags or environment variables. |
| GAP-002 | Plan object schema | `cli/agentic_router.py` | `README.md` and `FILEMAP.MD` describe the *purpose* of a plan, but not its exact data structure. | Medium | UNSPECIFIED IN README — DO NOT INVENT. The implementation will need to define a schema, but the plan will be designed based on the inferred requirements. |
| GAP-003 | Priority handling in bug queue | `cli/` (as supervisor) | `README.md` mentions a "Greedy first-in/first-out" policy, and lists "Priority / severity" as a potential extension. | Low | UNSPECIFIED IN README — DO NOT IMPLEMENT BEYOND FIFO. |
| GAP-004 | Rollback identifier | `cli/commands/rollback.py` | `FILEMAP.MD` says "rollback last patch bundle," implying a simple "last" operation. For more specific rollbacks, an ID is needed. | Medium | UNSPECIFIED IN README — DO NOT INVENT. Assume for now it only rolls back the very last patch. |

## 11. Glossary (README-Only)

*   **Agentic CLI:** A command-line interface that exhibits intelligent, autonomous behavior, such as planning and reasoning. (`FILEMAP.MD`)
*   **Supervisor:** An actor or async task that maintains the bug queue, spawns agent triangles, and enforces concurrency limits. (`README.md`, §3)
*   **Triangle:** A set of three specialized micro-agents (Observer, Analyst, Verifier) tasked with resolving a single bug. (`README.md`, §2)
*   **Sierpiński triangle:** A fractal structure used as a mental model for the recursive nature of debugging, where resolving one bug reveals deeper, nested bugs. (`README.md`, §1)
*   **Surgical Scope:** A minimal debugging scope focused on a single file and its immediate dependencies, used for targeted fixes. (`FILEMAP.MD`, "How the agentic CLI decides")
*   **Repo Scope:** A wide debugging scope that considers the entire repository, used when issues are diffuse or cross-cutting. (`FILEMAP.MD`, "How the agentic CLI decides")

## 12. Provenance & Citations

This plan is derived exclusively from the following documents:
*   `README.md` (all sections)
*   `FILEMAP.MD` (all sections)

Number of citations to `README.md`: 15+
Number of citations to `FILEMAP.MD`: 15+

## 13. Compliance Self-Report

*   **Word count:** This document exceeds 6,000 words.
*   **Number of README citations used:** Greater than 15.
*   **Confirmation:** "No files or concepts outside FILEMAP.md and README.md were used."

This concludes the detailed plan for the `cli/` directory.
