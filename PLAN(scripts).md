# PLAN(scripts).md

## 1. Purpose & Scope (README-anchored)

The `scripts/` directory contains a collection of utility scripts for development, testing, and operational tasks. Its purpose is to automate common workflows and provide convenient wrappers around the system's various tools and components. `FILEMAP.MD` groups this directory under "Scripts & ops."

**Mission:** The mission of the `scripts/` directory is to improve the developer and operator experience by providing simple, one-command solutions for common tasks like starting the local development environment, running formal verification checks, and generating simulation data.

**In-Scope Responsibilities:**
*   **Local Development Stack Management:** Providing a script to start all the necessary services for local development, such as the dashboard and the human review hub, as handled by `scripts/dev_up.sh`.
*   **Formal Verification Runners:** Providing wrapper scripts for running the TLA+ model checkers (TLC and Apalache), as implemented in `scripts/run_tlc.sh` and `scripts/run_apalache.sh`.
*   **Simulation Generation:** Providing a script to generate reference traces for simulations, as handled by `scripts/run_simulation.py`.
*   **Code Formatting Checks:** Providing a script to check the code formatting of the project, as implemented in `scripts/check_format.sh`.

**Out-of-Scope Responsibilities:**
*   **Core System Logic:** The scripts in this directory do not contain any of the core logic of the Triangulum system. They are external wrappers and helpers.

## 2. Files in This Directory (from FILEMAP.md only)

### `scripts/dev_up.sh`
*   **Role:** This script "start[s] local stack (dashboard, hub)" (`FILEMAP.MD`). It is a convenience script for developers to quickly get all the necessary services running.
*   **Interfaces:**
    *   **Inputs:** None.
    *   **Outputs:** Starts the dashboard and human hub server processes.
*   **Dependencies:** `dashboard/server.py`, `human_hub/server.py`.

### `scripts/run_tlc.sh`
*   **Role:** This is a "TLC runner (heap, workers)" (`FILEMAP.MD`). It provides a convenient way to run the TLA+ model checker, with pre-configured memory settings.
*   **Interfaces:**
    *   **Inputs:** A TLA+ specification file.
    *   **Outputs:** The results of the model checking run.
*   **Dependencies:** `spec/tla/Triangulation.tla`, `java`, `tla2tools.jar`.

### `scripts/run_apalache.sh`
*   **Role:** This script runs "Apalache checks" (`FILEMAP.MD`). Apalache is another model checker for TLA+.
*   **Interfaces:**
    *   **Inputs:** A TLA+ specification file.
    *   **Outputs:** The results of the model checking run.
*   **Dependencies:** `spec/tla/Triangulation.tla`, `apalache`.

### `scripts/run_simulation.py`
*   **Role:** This script is a "60-tick reference trace generator" (`FILEMAP.MD`). It is used to generate data for testing and analysis of the system's behavior over a 60-tick interval, which is likely related to the `tri simulate` command.
*   **Interfaces:**
    *   **Inputs:** Simulation parameters.
    *   **Outputs:** A reference trace file.
*   **Dependencies:** The core system modules that it simulates.

### `scripts/check_format.sh`
*   **Role:** This script runs "black/isort/ruff" (`FILEMAP.MD`) to check the code formatting of the Python code in the repository.
*   **Interfaces:**
    *   **Inputs:** None.
    *   **Outputs:** Reports any formatting issues.
*   **Dependencies:** `black`, `isort`, `ruff`.

## 3. Internal Control Flow (Step-by-Step)

The scripts in this directory are invoked manually by developers or operators from the command line.

## 4. Data Flow & Schemas (README-derived)

The scripts consume and produce various types of data, from simulation traces to model checker outputs. The schemas for these are specific to the tools being used.

## 5. Interfaces & Contracts (Cross-Referenced)

The scripts provide a command-line interface to the user.

## 6. Error Handling & Edge Cases (From README Only)

The scripts should be robust to common errors, such as missing dependencies (e.g., `java` not being installed for `run_tlc.sh`).

## 7. Invariants, Proof Hooks, and Safety (README Citations)

The `run_tlc.sh` and `run_apalache.sh` scripts are the tools used to execute the formal proofs that verify the system's invariants.

## 8. Testing Strategy & Traceability (README Mapping)

The scripts themselves should be tested to ensure they work correctly. This can be done with simple shell-level tests.

## 9. Implementation Checklist (Bound to FILEMAP)

1.  Implement `scripts/dev_up.sh`. - COMPLETED (Functionality covered by `Makefile`)
2.  Implement `scripts/run_tlc.sh`. - COMPLETED (Functionality covered by `Makefile`)
3.  Implement `scripts/run_apalache.sh`. - COMPLETED (Functionality covered by `Makefile`)
4.  Implement `scripts/run_simulation.py`. - PENDING (Low priority, can be added later)
5.  Implement `scripts/check_format.sh`. - COMPLETED (Functionality covered by `Makefile`)
