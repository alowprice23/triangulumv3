# PLAN(adapters).md

## 1. Purpose & Scope (README-anchored)

The `adapters/` directory serves as the bridge between the generic, language-agnostic core of the Triangulum system and the specific technologies of a target repository. Its purpose is to provide "Language adapters (enable single-file or repo-wide debugging)" (`FILEMAP.MD`). This directory is what makes the abstract concept of a "family tree" actionable by providing the concrete logic to map dependencies and tests within specific ecosystems like Python, Node.js, Java, and others.

**Mission:** The mission of the `adapters/` directory is to enable the Triangulum system to operate effectively across a wide range of programming languages and build systems. It achieves this by encapsulating all language-specific knowledge into a set of modular adapters. Each adapter provides the necessary logic to interact with a particular technology stack, from mapping tests to source files to invoking the correct build and test commands.

**In-Scope Responsibilities:**
*   **Language-Specific Test Mapping:** For each supported language, providing the logic to map source code modules to their corresponding test files (e.g., `*.py` to `test_*.py`, or a Java class to its JUnit test).
*   **Build System Integration:** Providing the logic to interact with common build systems like `npm`, `maven`, `pip`, etc. This includes detecting the build system and knowing how to run common commands like `install`, `build`, and `test`.
*   **Environment Management:** Handling language-specific environment concerns, such as Python virtual environments (`venv`) or Node.js workspaces.
*   **Command Generation:** Generating the precise command-line arguments for running tests, collecting coverage, and performing other language-specific tasks.

**Out-of-Scope Responsibilities:**
*   **Generic Tooling:** The `adapters/` directory does not implement generic tools like test runners or patch appliers. It only provides the language-specific configuration and command-line arguments for these tools, which are implemented in the `tooling/` directory.
*   **Core Agent Logic:** It does not contain any of the core agent logic. The agents in the `agents/` directory are language-agnostic and use the adapters to interact with the target repository.

### `adapters/go.py`
*   **Role:** This module provides the adapter for the Go ecosystem. It handles "`go mod` mapping; `go test` integration" (`FILEMAP.MD`).
*   **Key Responsibilities:**
    *   **Dependency Mapping:** Uses `go mod` to understand the project's dependencies.
    *   **Test Integration:** Generates `go test` commands for running tests.

## 3. Internal Control Flow (Step-by-Step)

The adapters are used by various parts of the system, particularly the `discovery/` and `agents/` directories.

1.  **Language Detection:** The `discovery/language_probe.py` detects the primary language of the repository.
2.  **Adapter Selection:** Based on the detected language, the system selects the appropriate adapter from the `adapters/` directory.
3.  **Test Location:** The `discovery/test_locator.py` uses the selected adapter's test mapping logic to find the tests for each source file.
4.  **Test Execution:** When the Verifier agent needs to run tests, it uses the selected adapter to generate the correct test command, which is then executed by `tooling/test_runner.py`.

## 4. Data Flow & Schemas (README-derived)

The adapters consume file paths and produce command strings and test mappings. The schemas for these are internal to the system and are **UNSPECIFIED IN README**.

## 5. Interfaces & Contracts (Cross-Referenced)

Each adapter module should expose a consistent interface.

*   `adapter.get_test_for_source(source_file)`:
    *   **Inputs:** A source file path.
    *   **Outputs:** A test file path.
*   `adapter.get_test_command(test_file)`:
    *   **Inputs:** A test file path.
    *   **Outputs:** A command string to execute the test.

## 6. Error Handling & Edge Cases (From README Only)

*   **Unsupported Language:** If the system encounters a language for which there is no adapter, it should handle this gracefully, possibly by falling back to generic, language-agnostic analysis.
*   **Missing Build Tools:** If an adapter requires a specific build tool (e.g., `maven`) that is not installed, it should detect this and report an error.

## 7. Invariants, Proof Hooks, and Safety (README Citations)

The `adapters/` directory contributes to the system's correctness by ensuring that the right tests are run for any given code change. This is essential for the Verifier agent to be able to do its job effectively.

## 8. Testing Strategy & Traceability (README Mapping)

The testing strategy for the `adapters/` directory should include unit tests for each adapter to ensure that it correctly maps source files to tests and generates the correct commands for various scenarios.
