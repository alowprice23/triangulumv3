# PLAN(obs).md

## 1. Purpose & Scope (README-anchored)

The `obs/` directory provides the observability layer for the Triangulum system, enabling operators to monitor its health, performance, and behavior. Its purpose, as described in `FILEMAP.MD`, is to handle "Observability & service surfaces," which also includes the `dashboard/` and `human_hub/` directories. This plan focuses specifically on the `obs/` part.

**Mission:** The mission of the `obs/` directory is to make the internal state and operations of the Triangulum system transparent and understandable to human operators and other monitoring systems. It achieves this by exporting metrics, sending heartbeats, and generating structured logs. This allows for real-time monitoring, alerting, and post-hoc analysis of the system's behavior.

**In-Scope Responsibilities:**
*   **Metrics Exporting:** Providing exporters for a standard metrics format like Prometheus, as handled by `obs/metrics.py`.
*   **Heartbeat Monitoring:** Sending regular heartbeats from key components like the supervisor and agents, and generating alerts if heartbeats are missed, as implemented in `obs/heartbeat.py`.
*   **Structured Logging:** Generating structured logs with span information for tracing and debugging the system itself, as handled by `obs/logging.py`.

**Out-of-Scope Responsibilities:**
*   **User Dashboards:** The `obs/` directory does not implement the user-facing dashboard. This is the responsibility of the `dashboard/` directory.
*   **Core System Logic:** It does not contain any of the core logic for debugging, scheduling, or state management. It is a passive observer of the system.

## 2. Files in This Directory (from FILEMAP.md only)

### `obs/__init__.py`
*   **Role:** Standard Python package initializer.

### `obs/metrics.py`
*   **Role:** This module is responsible for "Prometheus metrics exporters" (`FILEMAP.MD`). It collects key metrics from the system and exposes them in a format that can be scraped by a Prometheus server.
*   **Key Metrics (inferred from `README.md` and `FILEMAP.MD`):**
    *   `triangulum_agents_active`: The number of currently active agents.
    *   `triangulum_agents_free`: The number of free agents in the pool.
    *   `triangulum_bug_queue_length`: The number of bugs waiting in the queue.
    *   `triangulum_triangle_state_count`: A count of triangles in each state (`reproducing`, `patching`, etc.).
    *   `triangulum_entropy_h`: The current entropy of the system.
    *   `triangulum_information_gain_g`: The average information gain per cycle.
*   **Interfaces:**
    *   **Outputs:** An HTTP endpoint (e.g., `/metrics`) that exposes the metrics in Prometheus format.
*   **Dependencies:** `runtime/`, `entropy/`.

### `obs/heartbeat.py`
*   **Role:** This module implements "supervisor/agent heartbeats; lag alerts" (`FILEMAP.MD`). Heartbeats are a simple mechanism for monitoring the health of distributed components. If a component fails to send a heartbeat within a certain time, it is assumed to be down.
*   **Key Responsibilities:**
    *   **Heartbeat Sending:** Key components like the `runtime/supervisor` and the individual agents will call this module to send regular heartbeats.
    *   **Heartbeat Monitoring:** A separate process or thread will monitor the heartbeats and generate alerts if they are missed.
*   **Interfaces:**
    *   **Inputs:** Heartbeat signals from various components.
    *   **Outputs:** Alerts to a monitoring system.
*   **Dependencies:** `runtime/supervisor.py`, `agents/`.

### `obs/logging.py`
*   **Role:** This module handles "structured logs; spans" (`FILEMAP.MD`). Structured logs (e.g., in JSON format) are much easier to parse and analyze than plain text logs. Spans are used for distributed tracing, allowing operators to follow a single request or transaction as it flows through the system.
*   **Key Responsibilities:**
    *   **Log Formatting:** Formatting log messages into a structured format like JSON.
    *   **Span Management:** Creating and managing trace spans for key operations.
*   **Interfaces:**
    *   **Outputs:** Structured log messages written to stdout or a file.
*   **Dependencies:** None.

## 3. Internal Control Flow (Step-by-Step)

The `obs/` modules are called by various components throughout the system.

1.  **Logging:** Any component that needs to log a message will call `obs/logging.py`.
2.  **Metrics:** The `runtime/supervisor` will periodically call `obs/metrics.py` to update the metrics gauges.
3.  **Heartbeats:** The `runtime/supervisor` and the agents will call `obs/heartbeat.py` to send heartbeats.

## 4. Data Flow & Schemas (README-derived)

*   **Prometheus Metrics Format:** A well-defined text-based format.
*   **Structured Log Schema (JSON):**
    ```json
    {
      "timestamp": "iso8601_string",
      "level": "string", // "INFO", "WARNING", "ERROR"
      "message": "string",
      "span_id": "string",
      "trace_id": "string",
      "component": "string" // e.g., "runtime.supervisor"
    }
    ```

## 5. Interfaces & Contracts (Cross-Referenced)

*   `obs.logging.log(level, message, ...)`
*   `obs.metrics.set_gauge(name, value, ...)`
*   `obs.heartbeat.send(component_id)`

## 6. Error Handling & Edge Cases (From README Only)

*   **Monitoring System Unavailability:** If the monitoring system (e.g., Prometheus) is down, the `obs/` modules should handle this gracefully and not crash the main application.

## 7. Invariants, Proof Hooks, and Safety (README Citations)

The `obs/` directory provides the data that can be used to externally verify the system's invariants. For example, a monitoring system can be configured to alert if `triangulum_agents_active` ever exceeds 9.

## 8. Testing Strategy & Traceability (README Mapping)

The testing strategy for the `obs/` directory should include:
*   Unit tests for the log formatting.
*   Unit tests for the metrics exporting.
*   Integration tests to ensure that the observability components correctly reflect the state of a running system.

## 9. Implementation Checklist (Bound to FILEMAP)

1.  Implement `obs/logging.py` with structured JSON logging. - COMPLETED (Functionality covered by `monitoring/system_monitor.py` and a dedicated logging setup)
2.  Implement `obs/metrics.py` with a Prometheus exporter. - COMPLETED (Functionality covered by `monitoring/system_monitor.py`)
3.  Implement `obs/heartbeat.py`. - COMPLETED (Functionality covered by `monitoring/system_monitor.py`)

## 10. Information-Gap Log (Do Not Invent)

| ID | Topic | Where Needed (file/section) | README Evidence | Impact | Decision |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| GAP-020 | Alerting mechanism | `obs/heartbeat.py` | `FILEMAP.MD` mentions "lag alerts," but the mechanism for sending these alerts (e.g., email, PagerDuty) is not specified. | Medium | UNSPECIFIED IN README â€” DO NOT INVENT. The implementation can start by simply logging the alerts. |
