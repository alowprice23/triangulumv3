# PLAN(discovery).md

## 1. Purpose & Scope (README-anchored)

The `discovery/` directory is responsible for the critical initial phase of the Triangulum system's operation: understanding the target repository. As described in `FILEMAP.MD`, this directory's function is "Project discovery & 'family tree' graph." Its primary purpose is to programmatically explore a software project, identify its components, and map their interdependencies. This discovery process is the foundation upon which the "Agentic CLI" (`cli/`) builds its debugging plans.

**Mission:** The mission of the `discovery/` directory is to provide a comprehensive, accurate, and structured understanding of a target codebase. It achieves this by scanning the file system, probing for languages and build systems, indexing symbols and dependencies, and ultimately constructing a "family tree" that reveals the relationships between different parts of the code. This information is then used to propose a well-defined scope for the debugging task, which is essential for managing the complexity and entropy (H₀) of the problem space. This aligns with the `README.md`'s emphasis on a structured, reasoned approach to debugging, as opposed to a brute-force or random one.

**In-Scope Responsibilities:**
*   **File System Scanning:** Traversing the repository's file system to identify all relevant files, while respecting ignore rules from sources like `.gitignore`. This is handled by `discovery/repo_scanner.py` and `discovery/ignore_rules.py`.
*   **Project Probing:** Detecting the primary programming languages, build systems, and testing frameworks used in the project. This is the responsibility of `discovery/language_probe.py`, `discovery/build_systems.py`, and `discovery/test_locator.py`.
*   **Dependency Analysis:** Constructing a detailed dependency graph of the codebase. This involves indexing symbols (definitions, imports, references) and mapping the relationships between them. This is a core function, handled by `discovery/symbol_index.py` and `discovery/dep_graph.py`.
*   **"Family Tree" Computation:** For a given file or test, computing the transitive closure of its dependencies and dependents to identify the full "family tree" of impacted files. This is the key to enabling "surgical" debugging and is handled by `discovery/family_tree.py`.
*   **Scope Proposal:** Based on the dependency analysis, proposing one or more debugging scopes (e.g., "minimal" vs. "expanded") with associated entropy estimates. This is the primary output of the discovery process and is handled by `discovery/scope_proposals.py`.
*   **Manifest Generation:** Emitting a machine-readable manifest that summarizes the findings of the discovery process, including the list of files, tests, and a hash of the dependency graph. This is handled by `discovery/manifest.py`.

**Out-of-Scope Responsibilities:**
*   **Execution of Debugging Plans:** The `discovery/` directory is purely for analysis and planning. It does not execute any debugging tasks, run tests, or modify code. These are handled by the `runtime/` and `agents/` directories.
*   **User Interaction:** This directory does not have a direct user-facing interface. It is invoked by the `cli/` directory, which handles all user commands and communication.
*   **Entropy Calculation:** While it provides the inputs for entropy calculation (the size of the proposed scope), the actual calculation of H₀ and *g* is performed by the `entropy/` directory.

The `discovery/` directory is the sensory organ of the Triangulum system, providing the detailed environmental awareness necessary for the "agentic brain" in the `cli/` to make intelligent decisions.

## 2. Files in This Directory (from FILEMAP.md only)

This section provides a detailed breakdown of each file in the `discovery/` directory.

### `discovery/__init__.py`
*   **Role:** Standard Python package initializer. Marks the `discovery` directory as a package.

### `discovery/repo_scanner.py`
*   **Role:** This file is responsible for the initial traversal of the repository's file system. `FILEMAP.MD` states it "walk[s] filesystem, honor[s] `.gitignore`, language-aware filters." This is the first step in the discovery process, gathering the raw material (the list of all files) for further analysis.
*   **Interfaces:**
    *   **Inputs:** A root path to scan.
    *   **Outputs:** A list of file paths.
*   **Dependencies:** `discovery/ignore_rules.py` to determine which files to exclude.

### `discovery/ignore_rules.py`
*   **Role:** This module consolidates all ignore rules from various sources. `FILEMAP.MD` specifies that it "merge[s] `.gitignore`, `.triangulumignore`, defaults." This ensures that the system does not waste time analyzing irrelevant files like build artifacts, logs, or user-specific editor files.
*   **Interfaces:**
    *   **Inputs:** A root path (to find `.gitignore` and `.triangulumignore`).
    *   **Outputs:** A set of glob patterns for ignored files.
*   **Dependencies:** None.

### `discovery/language_probe.py`
*   **Role:** This module detects the primary programming languages and technologies used in the repository. `FILEMAP.MD` says it "detect[s] primary stack (Python/Node/Java/etc.)." This information is crucial for selecting the correct language-specific tools for parsing, dependency analysis, and testing.
*   **Interfaces:**
    *   **Inputs:** A list of file paths.
    *   **Outputs:** A data structure identifying the detected languages and their prevalence (e.g., `{ "Python": 0.8, "JavaScript": 0.2 }`). The exact schema is UNSPECIFIED IN README.
*   **Dependencies:** None.

### `discovery/build_systems.py`
*   **Role:** This module detects the build tools used in the project, such as "pip/poetry, npm/yarn/pnpm, maven/gradle" (`FILEMAP.MD`). This is important for understanding how to install dependencies and run builds, which is a prerequisite for running tests.
*   **Interfaces:**
    *   **Inputs:** A list of file paths (to look for files like `pyproject.toml`, `package.json`, `pom.xml`).
    *   **Outputs:** An identifier for the detected build system.
*   **Dependencies:** None.

### `discovery/test_locator.py`
*   **Role:** This module is responsible for finding all the test files in the repository and, crucially, "map[ping] them to modules" (`FILEMAP.MD`). This mapping is what allows the system to run only the relevant tests for a given piece of code, which is key to the efficiency of the "surgical" debugging strategy.
*   **Interfaces:**
    *   **Inputs:** A list of file paths.
    *   **Outputs:** A data structure that maps source files to their corresponding test files. The schema is UNSPECIFIED IN README.
*   **Dependencies:** This may depend on `discovery/language_probe.py` to use language-specific test file naming conventions (e.g., `test_*.py` for Python, `*.spec.ts` for TypeScript).

### `discovery/symbol_index.py`
*   **Role:** This is a sophisticated analysis module that performs a "fast ctags/pyast/ts AST summary: defs, imports, refs" (`FILEMAP.MD`). It builds an index of all the symbols (functions, classes, variables) in the codebase, which is the foundation for constructing the dependency graph.
*   **Interfaces:**
    *   **Inputs:** A list of source file paths.
    *   **Outputs:** A symbol index data structure. The schema is UNSPECIFIED IN README.
*   **Dependencies:** This module will likely use language-specific parsers (like Python's `ast` module) and may have a dependency on external tools like `ctags`.

### `discovery/dep_graph.py`
*   **Role:** This module takes the symbol index and "construct[s] multi-lang dependency graph (networkx)" (`FILEMAP.MD`). This graph represents the entire project's structure, with nodes being files or modules and edges being dependencies (e.g., imports). This graph is the central data structure for all further dependency analysis.
*   **Interfaces:**
    *   **Inputs:** A symbol index from `discovery/symbol_index.py`.
    *   **Outputs:** A graph object (e.g., a `networkx` graph).
*   **Dependencies:** `discovery/symbol_index.py`. It may also use the `networkx` library.

### `discovery/family_tree.py`
*   **Role:** This module performs one of the most critical functions in the `discovery` process: it "from a *target file or test*, compute[s] closure: upstream/downstream impacted files (the 'family tree')" (`FILEMAP.MD`). This is what enables the "surgical" debugging mode. By identifying the precise set of files related to a given target, it dramatically reduces the scope of the problem.
*   **Interfaces:**
    *   **Inputs:** A dependency graph and a target file or test.
    *   **Outputs:** A set of file paths representing the "family tree."
*   **Dependencies:** `discovery/dep_graph.py`.

### `discovery/scope_proposals.py`
*   **Role:** This module takes all the information gathered so far and "propose[s] scopes (minimal set vs. expanded set) with entropy caps" (`FILEMAP.MD`). It synthesizes the analysis into concrete, actionable proposals for the `cli/agentic_router.py`.
*   **Interfaces:**
    *   **Inputs:** The dependency graph, family trees, and test mappings.
    *   **Outputs:** A list of scope proposals, each with a file list, test list, and an entropy estimate.
*   **Dependencies:** `discovery/dep_graph.py`, `discovery/family_tree.py`, `discovery/test_locator.py`, `entropy/estimator.py`.

### `discovery/manifest.py`
*   **Role:** This module "emit[s] machine-readable manifest: files, tests, graph hash" (`FILEMAP.MD`). This manifest serves as a snapshot of the project's state at a particular point in time. The hash of the graph can be used to detect if the project's structure has changed, which might invalidate previous plans.
*   **Interfaces:**
    *   **Inputs:** The results of the discovery process (file list, test map, graph).
    *   **Outputs:** A JSON manifest file.
*   **Dependencies:** All other modules in the `discovery/` directory.

## 3. Internal Control Flow (Step-by-Step)

The `discovery/` directory is typically invoked by the `cli/agentic_router.py` as part of the "scan" and "scope" phases of a `tri run` or `tri plan` command. The control flow is as follows:

1.  **Initiation:** The `agentic_router` calls a main function in the `discovery` package, providing the root path of the repository.

2.  **Scanning and Filtering:**
    *   `repo_scanner.py` is called to get a list of all files in the repository.
    *   During the scan, `ignore_rules.py` is consulted to filter out ignored files.

3.  **Probing:**
    *   `language_probe.py` analyzes the file extensions to determine the project's technology stack.
    *   `build_systems.py` looks for build-related files (`package.json`, `pom.xml`, etc.) to identify the build system.
    *   `test_locator.py` uses language-specific patterns to find all test files and map them to the source files they cover.

4.  **Symbol Indexing and Graph Construction:**
    *   `symbol_index.py` parses all the source files to create an index of symbols (functions, classes, imports, etc.).
    *   `dep_graph.py` takes this symbol index and constructs a `networkx` dependency graph, representing the entire project's architecture.

5.  **Family Tree and Scope Proposal:**
    *   If the user specified a single file, `family_tree.py` is used to compute the dependency closure for that file, creating a "surgical" scope.
    *   If the user specified a directory, the full dependency graph is used to propose a wider scope.
    *   `scope_proposals.py` takes these inputs and generates one or more scope proposals, each with an associated entropy estimate from the `entropy/` module.

6.  **Manifest Generation:**
    *   `manifest.py` takes the final results (the proposed scope, the file list, the test map, and the dependency graph) and writes them to a machine-readable JSON manifest file. This manifest is then returned to the `agentic_router`.

This flow from raw file system to structured, actionable scope proposals is the core contribution of the `discovery/` directory.

## 4. Data Flow & Schemas (README-derived)

The `discovery/` directory produces a key data artifact: the **manifest**.

*   **Manifest Schema (inferred from `FILEMAP.MD`):**
    ```json
    {
      "version": "1.0",
      "project_root": "/path/to/project",
      "files": [
        {
          "path": "string", // Relative path to file
          "language": "string", // e.g., "Python"
          "hash": "string" // SHA-256 hash of file content
        }
      ],
      "tests": {
        "test_file_path": ["source_file_path"] // Mapping tests to source files
      },
      "dependency_graph": {
        "nodes": [ { "id": "string" } ],
        "edges": [ { "source": "string", "target": "string" } ],
        "hash": "string" // Hash of the graph structure
      },
      "proposed_scopes": [
        {
          "name": "surgical_scope_for_main_py",
          "files": ["string"],
          "tests": ["string"],
          "entropy_H0": "float"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
    This manifest is the primary output of the `discovery` process and the primary input for the `cli/agentic_router`'s planning.

## 5. Interfaces & Contracts (Cross-Referenced)

The `discovery/` directory provides an internal API to the rest of the system.

*   `discovery.run_discovery(path)`:
    *   **Inputs:** A repository path.
    *   **Outputs:** A manifest object (as described above).
    *   **Contract:** This function is the main entry point to the discovery process. It is guaranteed to return a structured manifest that accurately reflects the state of the repository at the time of the scan.

## 6. Error Handling & Edge Cases (From README Only)

The `discovery/` directory must be robust to various project structures and potential issues.

*   **Unsupported Languages/Frameworks:** If `language_probe.py` or `build_systems.py` encounter a technology that is not supported, they should gracefully handle it, possibly by marking the language as "unknown" and proceeding with generic analysis where possible. This is an information gap, as the `README.md` does not specify the full list of supported technologies.
*   **Malformed Code:** `symbol_index.py` might encounter files with syntax errors. It should be ableto handle these without crashing, for example by skipping the malformed file and logging a warning.
*   **Circular Dependencies:** `dep_graph.py` must be able to handle circular dependencies in the codebase. The use of `networkx` suggests that this is possible, as it can represent cyclic graphs.

## 7. Invariants, Proof Hooks, and Safety (README Citations)

The main invariant that the `discovery/` directory contributes to is the principle of **bounded rationality**. By providing a well-defined scope and an entropy estimate (H₀), it ensures that the debugging process starts with a manageable problem space. This is a prerequisite for the entropy-drain model described in the chat history to be applicable. Without the work of the `discovery/` directory, the initial entropy H₀ would be effectively infinite, and the system could not guarantee termination.

## 8. Testing Strategy & Traceability (README Mapping)

| Plan Statement | README/FILEMAP Responsibility | Test File | Test Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Dependency closure correctness | `discovery/family_tree.py` | `tests/unit/test_family_tree.py` | Unit |
| Manifest integrity and hashing | `discovery/manifest.py` | `tests/unit/test_manifest.py` | Unit |

The testing strategy should cover:
*   Correct parsing of various project structures.
*   Correct identification of languages, build systems, and tests.
*   Correct construction of the dependency graph.
*   Correct computation of the "family tree" for different targets.
