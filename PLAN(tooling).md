# PLAN(tooling).md

## 1. Purpose & Scope (README-anchored)

The `tooling/` directory provides a suite of essential utilities that serve as the "hands" of the agentic system. Its purpose is to equip the Observer, Analyst, and Verifier agents with the concrete tools they need to interact with the target repository, manage data, and execute tasks. This directory is responsible for "scope, compression, patch, testing, sandbox" (`FILEMAP.MD`).

**Mission:** The mission of the `tooling/` directory is to provide a robust and reliable set of tools that abstract away the complexities of common software development tasks. By providing these tools, the `tooling/` directory allows the agents in the `agents/` directory to focus on their high-level reasoning tasks (observing, analyzing, verifying) without needing to implement the low-level details of file manipulation, test execution, or data compression themselves.

**In-Scope Responsibilities:**
*   **Scope Filtering:** Applying filtering rules to limit the scope of analysis and clamp the initial entropy (H₀), as handled by `tooling/scope_filter.py`.
*   **Data Compression:** Compressing large text-based artifacts like logs and test outputs to fit within the context windows of language models, as implemented in `tooling/compress.py`.
*   **Patch Management:** Creating and applying patch bundles, which are the primary mechanism for code modification, as handled by `tooling/patch_bundle.py` and `tooling/repair.py`.
*   **Test Execution:** Providing harnesses for running various types of tests, including unit tests, fuzz tests, canary tests, and smoke tests. This is the responsibility of `tooling/test_runner.py`, `tooling/fuzz_runner.py`, `tooling/canary_runner.py`, and `tooling/smoke_runner.py`.
*   **Sandboxed Execution:** Providing a secure and isolated environment for running processes, with resource limits and other safety constraints, as implemented in `tooling/sandbox.py`.
*   **Context Management:** Structuring and trimming the context provided to language models to ensure it is both informative and concise, as handled by `tooling/context_window.py`.

**Out-of-Scope Responsibilities:**
*   **Agent Logic:** The `tooling/` directory does not contain any of the high-level reasoning or decision-making logic of the agents. It only provides the tools that the agents use.
*   **State Management:** It does not manage the overall state of the debugging process. This is the responsibility of the `runtime/` directory.

## 2. Files in This Directory (from FILEMAP.md only)

### `tooling/__init__.py`
*   **Role:** Standard Python package initializer.

### `tooling/scope_filter.py`
*   **Role:** This module is responsible for applying "allow/deny globs; clamp H₀" (`FILEMAP.MD`). It is a critical component for controlling the complexity of the debugging task by limiting the number of files the agents need to consider.
*   **Interfaces:**
    *   **Inputs:** A list of file paths and a set of allow/deny patterns.
    *   **Outputs:** A filtered list of file paths.
*   **Dependencies:** None.

### `tooling/compress.py`
*   **Role:** This module is a "log/test-output compressor, token budgeter" (`FILEMAP.MD`). It is essential for managing the large amounts of text data that can be generated during the debugging process, ensuring that it can be processed by language models with limited context windows.

    *   **Inputs:** A diff representing a code change.
    *   **Outputs:** A patch bundle file.
*   **Dependencies:** `git`.

### `tooling/repair.py`
*   **Role:** This module is a "DAG-aware patch applier (Tarjan SCC, ripple scoring)" (`FILEMAP.MD`). It provides a sophisticated mechanism for applying patches in a way that respects the dependencies within the codebase, minimizing the risk of introducing new errors.
*   **Interfaces:**
    *   **Inputs:** A patch bundle and a dependency graph.
    *   **Outputs:** The result of the patch application.
*   **Dependencies:** `discovery/dep_graph.py`.

### `tooling/test_runner.py`

*   **Interfaces:**
    *   **Inputs:** A set of tests to run.
    *   **Outputs:** A JSON report of the test results.
*   **Dependencies:** None.

### `tooling/fuzz_runner.py`
*   **Role:** This module provides "quick fuzz hooks for supported stacks" (`FILEMAP.MD`). Fuzz testing is a technique for finding edge case bugs by providing random inputs to the program.
*   **Interfaces:**
    *   **Inputs:** A target to fuzz.
    *   **Outputs:** The results of the fuzz testing.
*   **Dependencies:** Language-specific fuzzing tools.

### `tooling/canary_runner.py`
*   **Role:** This module implements a "docker-compose canary; health probe" (`FILEMAP.MD`). A canary test involves deploying the patched code to a limited production-like environment to check for issues before a full rollout.
*   **Interfaces:**
    *   **Inputs:** A patch to be deployed.
    *   **Outputs:** The result of the canary test.
*   **Dependencies:** `docker-compose`.

### `tooling/smoke_runner.py`

*   **Interfaces:**
    *   **Inputs:** A canary deployment.
    *   **Outputs:** A JSON report of the smoke test results.
*   **Dependencies:** `tooling/canary_runner.py`.

### `tooling/sandbox.py`
*   **Role:** This module provides a "jailed subprocess/limits (timeouts, env)" (`FILEMAP.MD`). It is a critical safety feature that allows the system to run arbitrary code (like tests or the target program itself) in an isolated environment with resource limits.
*   **Interfaces:**
    *   **Inputs:** A command to be executed.
    *   **Outputs:** The result of the command execution.
*   **Dependencies:** None.

### `tooling/context_window.py`

*   **Interfaces:**
    *   **Inputs:** A set of contextual information (e.g., logs, code snippets).
    *   **Outputs:** A structured and trimmed prompt.
*   **Dependencies:** `tooling/compress.py`.

## 3. Internal Control Flow (Step-by-Step)

The tools in the `tooling/` directory are invoked by the agents in the `agents/` directory as needed.

*   The **Observer** agent might use `tooling/test_runner.py` to run a failing test and `tooling/compress.py` to compress the logs.
*   The **Analyst** agent might use `tooling/patch_bundle.py` to create a patch.
*   The **Verifier** agent is a heavy user of the `tooling/` directory. It uses `tooling/patch_bundle.py` to apply the patch, `tooling/test_runner.py` to run unit tests, `tooling/fuzz_runner.py` to run fuzz tests, `tooling/canary_runner.py` to deploy to a canary environment, and `tooling/smoke_runner.py` to run smoke tests.
*   All agents use `tooling/sandbox.py` to execute commands in a safe environment and `tooling/context_window.py` to manage their interaction with the LLMs.

## 4. Data Flow & Schemas (README-derived)

The `tooling/` directory deals with a variety of data formats.

*   **Patch Bundle:** A standardized format for code changes.
*   **Test Reports:** JSON reports from `test_runner.py` and `smoke_runner.py`.
*   **Compressed Text:** The output of `compress.py`.

## 5. Interfaces & Contracts (Cross-Referenced)

Each file in the `tooling/` directory provides a clear, well-defined API to the rest of the system. For example:

*   `tooling.test_runner.run_tests(tests)`:
    *   **Inputs:** A list of tests.
    *   **Outputs:** A JSON report.
*   `tooling.compress.compress_text(text)`:
    *   **Inputs:** A string.
    *   **Outputs:** A compressed string.

## 6. Error Handling & Edge Cases (From README Only)

*   **Tool Failure:** Any of the tools could fail (e.g., a test runner might crash). The tools should be designed to handle such failures gracefully and report them to the calling agent.
*   **Unsupported Stacks:** Some tools, like `fuzz_runner.py`, are language-specific. They must be able to detect when they are being used in an unsupported environment and report this.

## 7. Invariants, Proof Hooks, and Safety (README Citations)

The `tooling/` directory plays a key role in maintaining the system's safety and correctness.
*   `tooling/sandbox.py` is a critical safety feature.
*   `tooling/test_runner.py` provides the ground truth for the Verifier agent.
*   `tooling/scope_filter.py` helps to enforce the bounded rationality of the system.
