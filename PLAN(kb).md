# PLAN(kb).md

## 1. Purpose & Scope (README-anchored)

The `kb/` directory, in conjunction with `storage/`, forms the persistence and knowledge management layer of the Triangulum system. Its purpose, as described in `FILEMAP.MD`, is to manage "Knowledge & persistence." This directory is responsible for storing and retrieving the system's long-term knowledge, which is essential for learning and improving its debugging performance over time.

**Mission:** The mission of the `kb/` directory is to provide a durable, queryable repository for the knowledge gained during bug-fixing sessions. This includes learned constraints, the lineage of bugs and their fixes, and historical project manifests. The `README.md` (ยง5, "Implementation Sketch") suggests a "Knowledge base" to "so future agents can query prior wisdom," and this directory is the implementation of that concept.

**In-Scope Responsibilities:**
*   **Constraint Storage:** Storing, deduplicating, and managing the lifecycle (including Time-To-Live, or TTL) of learned constraints, as handled by `kb/constraint_store.py`.
*   **Lineage Tracking:** Recording the parent/child relationships between bugs and the audit chain of actions taken to resolve them, as implemented in `kb/lineage.py`.
*   **Manifest Archiving:** Storing and retrieving historical project manifests, which serve as snapshots of the repository's state, as handled by `kb/manifest_store.py`.

**Out-of-Scope Responsibilities:**
*   **Low-Level Storage Mechanics:** The `kb/` directory defines *what* is stored, but the low-level mechanics of writing to disk, such as the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) and snapshotting, are handled by the `storage/` directory.
*   **Agent Memory:** The `agents/memory.py` module provides the in-memory representation of the knowledge base for the agents. The `kb/` directory is the persistence layer for that memory.

## 2. Files in This Directory (from FILEMAP.md only)

### `kb/__init__.py`
*   **Role:** Standard Python package initializer.

### `kb/constraint_store.py`
*   **Role:** This module is responsible for managing "learned constraints; dedup; TTL" (`FILEMAP.MD`). A learned constraint is a piece of knowledge gained from a failed test or a logical deduction, which helps to prune the search space for future debugging tasks.
*   **Key Responsibilities:**
    *   **Storage:** Persisting learned constraints to disk.
    *   **Deduplication:** Ensuring that the same constraint is not stored multiple times.
    *   **TTL (Time-To-Live):** Managing the lifecycle of constraints, so that old, potentially stale constraints can be expired.
*   **Interfaces:**
    *   **Inputs:** A new learned constraint.
    *   **Outputs:** Stores the constraint in the knowledge base.
*   **Dependencies:** `storage/`.

### `kb/lineage.py`
*   **Role:** This module tracks the "parent/child relationships; audit chain" (`FILEMAP.MD`). This is crucial for understanding the "fractal" nature of the debugging process, where fixing one bug can reveal another. It also provides an audit trail for human review.
*   **Key Responsibilities:**
    *   **Parent/Child Tracking:** Recording when a bug resolution leads to the spawning of a new, "child" bug.
    *   **Audit Chain:** Logging the sequence of actions (e.g., patches applied, tests run) for each bug.
*   **Interfaces:**
    *   **Inputs:** Events from the `runtime/supervisor` about bug resolutions and spawns.
    *   **Outputs:** A persistent record of the bug lineage.
*   **Dependencies:** `storage/`.

### `kb/manifest_store.py`
*   **Role:** This module is responsible for "store/retrieve manifests + hashes" (`FILEMAP.MD`). Manifests, generated by the `discovery` module, are valuable historical records of the project's state.
*   **Key Responsibilities:**
    *   **Storage:** Archiving project manifests.
    *   **Retrieval:** Providing access to historical manifests.
*   **Interfaces:**
    *   **Inputs:** A manifest object from the `discovery` module.
    *   **Outputs:** Stores the manifest.
*   **Dependencies:** `discovery/manifest.py`, `storage/`.

## 3. Internal Control Flow (Step-by-Step)

The `kb/` modules are called by other parts of the system whenever new knowledge is generated.

1.  **Manifest Storage:** After the `discovery` process completes, the `cli/agentic_router` can call `kb/manifest_store.py` to archive the newly generated manifest.
2.  **Constraint Learning:** When the Observer agent identifies a new failing test, the `runtime/supervisor` can call `kb/constraint_store.py` to store this as a learned constraint.
3.  **Lineage Tracking:** When the `runtime/supervisor` spawns a new bug as a result of a parent bug's resolution, it calls `kb/lineage.py` to record this relationship.

## 4. Data Flow & Schemas (README-derived)

*   **Learned Constraint Schema:** **UNSPECIFIED IN README**.
*   **Lineage Schema:** **UNSPECIFIED IN README**.
*   **Manifest Schema:** Defined in `PLAN(discovery).md`.

### 4.1. Knowledge Base Schemas (New)

To address `GAP-016` and `GAP-017`, the following JSON-based schemas are defined for the core knowledge base objects.

*   **Learned Constraint Schema:** This object represents a piece of knowledge that reduces the problem's search space.

    ```json
    {
      "constraint_type": "learned_constraint",
      "version": "1.0",
      "constraint_id": "<Unique ID for the constraint, e.g., a hash of the data>",
      "source": {
        "type": "observer_run" | "analyst_deduction",
        "bug_id": "<ID of the bug that produced this constraint>",
        "agent_id": "<ID of the agent that learned this>"
      },
      "timestamp": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ",
      "ttl_seconds": "<Time-to-live for this constraint, e.g., 86400>",
      "constraint_data": {
        "type": "stack_trace_hash" | "failed_assertion" | "symbol_exclusion",
        "value": "<The actual constraint value, e.g., a SHA-256 hash of a stack trace>",
        "description": "<Human-readable description of the constraint>"
      },
      "entropy_reduction_bits": "<Estimated reduction in entropy (delta H) provided by this constraint>"
    }
    ```

*   **Bug Lineage Schema:** This object represents a single event in the life cycle of a bug, primarily for tracking the "fractal" spawning of new bugs from the resolution of others.

    ```json
    {
      "lineage_record_type": "bug_lineage_event",
      "version": "1.0",
      "event_id": "<Unique ID for this lineage event, e.g., a UUID>",
      "timestamp": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ",
      "event_type": "spawn" | "resolve",
      "parent_bug_id": "<ID of the parent bug>",
      "child_bug_id": "<ID of the child bug, if event_type is 'spawn'>",
      "resolution_patch_bundle_id": "<ID of the patch bundle that resolved the parent, leading to this event>",
      "details": "<Human-readable details about the event, e.g., 'Fix for bug X revealed a null pointer exception in module Y'>"
    }
    ```

## 5. Interfaces & Contracts (Cross-Referenced)

*   `kb.store_constraint(constraint)`
*   `kb.record_lineage(parent_bug, child_bug)`
*   `kb.store_manifest(manifest)`

## 6. Error Handling & Edge Cases (From README Only)

*   **Storage Failure:** The `kb/` modules must handle potential I/O errors when interacting with the `storage/` layer.

## 7. Invariants, Proof Hooks, and Safety (README Citations)

The `kb/` directory contributes to the system's long-term improvement and auditability. The integrity of the knowledge base is crucial for the effectiveness of the learning mechanisms in `agents/memory.py` and `agents/meta_tuner.py`.

## 8. Testing Strategy & Traceability (README Mapping)

The testing strategy for the `kb/` directory should include unit tests for each module to ensure that data is stored and retrieved correctly.
