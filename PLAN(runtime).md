# PLAN(runtime).md

## 1. Purpose & Scope (README-anchored)

The `runtime/` directory is the operational core of the Triangulum system, responsible for executing the debugging plans devised by the `cli/` and `discovery/` modules. Its purpose, as described in `FILEMAP.MD`, is to provide the "Runtime state machine & scheduling." This directory is where the abstract concepts of the "Fractal-Triangle Mental Model" and the formal mathematical specifications from `README.md` are translated into concrete, running code.

**Mission:** The mission of the `runtime/` directory is to manage the state, transitions, and execution of the agent "Triangles" in a deterministic, safe, and efficient manner. It acts as the engine that drives the O→A→V cycles, ensuring that the system adheres to its invariants, respects its resource constraints, and makes steady progress toward bug resolution. It is the implementation of the "Supervisor" and the state automaton (`σᵢ(t)`) described in the `README.md`'s formal model.

**In-Scope Responsibilities:**
*   **State Management:** Defining and managing the states of the debugging process (`waiting`, `reproducing`, `patching`, etc.), as well as associated data like timers and attempt counters. This is handled by `runtime/state.py`.
*   **State Transitions:** Implementing the deterministic state transition function `T(s, τ, attempts, agents)`, as specified in `runtime/transition.py` and `README.md`.
*   **Invariant Enforcement:** Actively checking and enforcing system invariants, such as agent capacity and safety conditions, as implemented in `runtime/invariants.py`.
*   **Scheduling:** Managing the queue of bugs and scheduling them for execution based on a defined policy (e.g., priority, fairness), as handled by `runtime/scheduler.py`.
*   **Resource Management:** Allocating and deallocating agents to bug-fixing tasks, including the atomic allocation of agent triplets, as implemented in `runtime/allocator.py` and `runtime/parallel_executor.py`.
*   **Supervision and Control:** Running the main "tick loop" that drives the entire system, integrating the scheduler, PID controller, and spawn policies. This is the core responsibility of `runtime/supervisor.py`.
*   **Rollback Management:** Managing the registry of patch bundles and providing the functionality to revert them, as handled by `runtime/rollback_manager.py`.

**Out-of-Scope Responsibilities:**
*   **Planning and Scoping:** The `runtime/` directory does not create debugging plans or define their scope. It receives fully-formed plans from the `cli/` directory.
*   **Agent-Specific Logic:** It does not implement the specific behaviors of the Observer, Analyst, and Verifier agents. It only manages their state and execution. The agent logic resides in the `agents/` directory.
*   **User Interface:** It has no direct user interface. It is a backend service controlled by the `cli/`.

The `runtime/` directory is the tireless engine of the Triangulum system, ensuring that the abstract debugging strategy is executed reliably and in accordance with the system's foundational mathematical principles.

## 2. Files in This Directory (from FILEMAP.md only)

### `runtime/__init__.py`
*   **Role:** Standard Python package initializer.

### `runtime/state.py`
*   **Role:** Defines the core data structures for representing the state of the system. `FILEMAP.MD` says it contains "states, timers, attempts; dataclasses." This module is the implementation of the state alphabet Σ from the `README.md`'s formal model (`Σ = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`).

## 3. Internal Control Flow (Step-by-Step)

1.  **Initiation:** The `cli/commands/run.py` calls the `runtime/supervisor.py` with a debugging plan.
2.  **Scheduling:** The `supervisor` passes the bug to the `scheduler.py`, which places it in the bug queue according to its priority.
3.  **PID Control:** The `pid.py` controller monitors the queue length and agent utilization, and advises the `supervisor` on the rate at which to process bugs.
4.  **Execution:** When a bug is scheduled, the `supervisor` passes it to the `parallel_executor.py`.
5.  **Allocation:** The `parallel_executor` requests 3 agents from the `allocator.py`.
6.  **Triangle Execution:** Once the agents are allocated, the `parallel_executor` starts the O→A→V cycle for the bug, which is managed by `agents/coordinator.py`.
7.  **State Transitions:** With each step of the agent cycle, the state of the bug is updated by the `transition.py` function, as defined by the formal automaton in `README.md`.
8.  **Invariant Checks:** At each state transition, `invariants.py` is called to ensure the system remains in a valid state.
9.  **Resolution and Spawning:** If the bug is resolved, the `spawn_policy.py` is consulted to see if a new, deeper bug needs to be spawned. If so, it is added to the `deferred_queue.py`.
10. **Rollback:** If a patch needs to be reverted, the `rollback_manager.py` is called.

## 4. Data Flow & Schemas (README-derived)

*   **Bug State Object:**
    *   Defined in `runtime/state.py`.
    *   Schema (from `README.md`): `{ "id": "string", "state": "enum", "timer": "int", "attempts": "int" }`.
*   **Patch Bundle:**
    *   A data package containing a code patch. The exact format is UNSPECIFIED IN README.

## 5. Interfaces & Contracts (Cross-Referenced)

*   `runtime.start_debugging(plan)`: Main entry point.
*   `runtime.get_status()`: Returns the system status.
*   `runtime.rollback_patch(patch_id)`: Reverts a patch.

## 6. Error Handling & Edge Cases (From README Only)

*   **Invariant Violation:** If `invariants.py` detects a violation, the system should enter a safe mode and escalate to a human.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** If the agent pool is exhausted, new bugs must be queued.
*   **PID Controller Instability:** The PID controller must have anti-windup mechanisms to prevent oscillations.

## 7. Invariants, Proof Hooks, and Safety (README Citations)

The `runtime/` directory is the ultimate enforcer of all the invariants defined in the `README.md`'s formal model. It is the implementation of the proofs of safety and liveness.
