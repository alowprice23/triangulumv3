# PLAN(spec).md

## 1. Purpose & Scope (README-anchored)

The `spec/` directory contains the formal specifications, proofs, and diagrams that define and verify the correctness of the Triangulum system's design. Its purpose, as described in `FILEMAP.MD`, is to house the "Formal proofs & model checking" artifacts. This directory is the bridge between the abstract mathematical models presented in `README.md` and the concrete implementation of the system.

**Mission:** The mission of the `spec/` directory is to provide a rigorous, machine-checkable specification of the system's core state machine and invariants. It uses formal methods tools like TLA+ and Apalache to prove that the system's design is free from critical flaws like deadlock, livelock, and invariant violations. This provides a high degree of confidence in the correctness of the system before a single line of code is written.

**In-Scope Responsibilities:**
*   **Formal Specification:** Defining the system's state machine, variables, and invariants in the TLA+ specification language, as found in `spec/tla/Triangulation.tla`.
*   **Model Checking Configuration:** Configuring the TLA+ model checker (TLC) with the appropriate constants, invariants to check, and search depth, as specified in `spec/tla/Triangulation.cfg`.
*   **Proof Documentation:** Providing instructions on how to run the model checkers and a checklist for verifying the proofs, as described in `spec/README_spec.md`.
*   **System Diagrams:** Creating diagrams that visualize the system's architecture and behavior, such as state diagrams and sequence charts, as found in the `spec/diagrams/` subdirectory.

**Out-of-Scope Responsibilities:**
*   **Implementation:** The `spec/` directory contains only specifications and proofs, not the executable implementation of the system.
*   **Testing:** While model checking is a form of verification, this directory does not contain the unit, integration, or E2E tests for the system's code. Those reside in the `tests/` directory.

## 2. Files in This Directory (from FILEMAP.md only)

### `spec/README_spec.md`
*   **Role:** This file is the guide to the formal verification process. It explains "how to run TLC/Apalache; proof checklist" (`FILEMAP.MD`).
*   **Interfaces:**
    *   **Inputs:** None.
    *   **Outputs:** Human-readable instructions.
*   **Dependencies:** None.

### `spec/tla/Triangulation.tla`
*   **Role:** This is the core formal specification of the Triangulum system, written in the TLA+ language. It defines the "state machine + invariants" (`FILEMAP.MD`). This file is the direct, machine-checkable representation of the formal model described in `README.md`.
*   **Interfaces:**
    *   **Inputs:** None.
    *   **Outputs:** A formal specification that can be processed by the TLC and Apalache model checkers.
*   **Dependencies:** None.

### `spec/tla/Triangulation.cfg`
*   **Role:** This is the configuration file for the TLA+ model checker. It specifies the "constants, invariants, depth" (`FILEMAP.MD`) for a model checking run.
*   **Interfaces:**
    *   **Inputs:** None.
    *   **Outputs:** Configuration for the TLC model checker.
*   **Dependencies:** `spec/tla/Triangulation.tla`.

### `spec/diagrams/state_diagram.puml`
*   **Role:** This file contains the "PlantUML of states" (`FILEMAP.MD`). PlantUML is a tool for creating diagrams from plain text descriptions. This file defines the state diagram of the system's state machine.
*   **Interfaces:**
    *   **Inputs:** None.
    *   **Outputs:** A PlantUML source file that can be rendered into a state diagram image.
*   **Dependencies:** None.

### `spec/diagrams/sequence_15_tick.svg`
*   **Role:** This file is a "sequence chart" (`FILEMAP.MD`). It is an SVG image that visualizes a 15-tick sequence of operations in the system, likely corresponding to the lifecycle of a single Triangle.
*   **Interfaces:**
    *   **Inputs:** None.
    *   **Outputs:** An SVG image.
*   **Dependencies:** None.

## 3. Internal Control Flow (Step-by-Step)

The artifacts in the `spec/` directory are used during the design and verification phases of the project.

1.  **Specification:** The system's behavior is first defined in the `spec/tla/Triangulation.tla` file.
2.  **Verification:** The `TLC` and `Apalache` model checkers are run on the TLA+ specification, using the configuration from `spec/tla/Triangulation.cfg`, to check for errors.
3.  **Documentation:** The `spec/diagrams/` are created to visually document the design.
4.  **Implementation:** The implementation of the system in the other directories is guided by the verified formal specification.

## 4. Data Flow & Schemas (README-derived)

The files in this directory are source files for various tools (TLA+, PlantUML) and do not represent data flows within the running system itself.

## 5. Interfaces & Contracts (Cross-Referenced)

The TLA+ specification in `spec/tla/Triangulation.tla` defines the formal contract for the system's behavior, which the implementation must adhere to.

## 6. Error Handling & Edge Cases (From README Only)

Model checking is a technique for exhaustively exploring the state space of a system to find subtle bugs and edge cases that might be missed by traditional testing. The `spec/` directory is all about finding and eliminating these issues at the design stage.

## 7. Invariants, Proof Hooks, and Safety (README Citations)

This directory is the home of the system's invariants. `spec/tla/Triangulation.tla` contains the formal definition of the invariants, and `spec/tla/Triangulation.cfg` tells the model checker to verify them.

## 8. Testing Strategy & Traceability (README Mapping)

Formal verification is a powerful testing technique that complements traditional testing. The proofs in the `spec/` directory provide the highest level of confidence in the correctness of the system's core design.

## 9. Implementation Checklist (Bound to FILEMAP)

1.  Write the TLA+ specification in `spec/tla/Triangulation.tla`.
2.  Configure the model checker in `spec/tla/Triangulation.cfg`.
3.  Create the diagrams in the `spec/diagrams/` directory.
4.  Write the `spec/README_spec.md` to document the process.

## 10. Information-Gap Log (Do Not Invent)
