# PLAN(tests).md

## 1. Purpose & Scope (README-anchored)

The `tests/` directory provides the comprehensive testing suite for the Triangulum system, ensuring its correctness, robustness, and adherence to the formal specifications. Its purpose is to verify every component of the system, from the lowest-level data structures to the end-to-end behavior of the agentic CLI. `FILEMAP.MD` organizes the tests into four categories: "unit, property, concurrency, e2e."

**Mission:** The mission of the `tests/` directory is to provide a high degree of confidence in the quality and reliability of the Triangulum system. It achieves this through a multi-layered testing strategy that covers all aspects of the system's functionality, from the mathematical correctness of its core algorithms to the real-world performance of its end-to-end workflows.

**In-Scope Responsibilities:**
*   **Unit Testing:** Verifying the correctness of individual components in isolation.
*   **Property-Based Testing:** Testing the properties and invariants of the system over a wide range of inputs.
*   **Concurrency Testing:** Testing the system's behavior in a multi-threaded or concurrent environment, with a focus on race conditions and deadlocks.
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** Testing the full, integrated system from the command-line interface to the final output, simulating real-world usage scenarios.

**Out-of-Scope Responsibilities:**
*   **Formal Verification:** The `tests/` directory does not contain the formal proofs of the system's design. Those reside in the `spec/` directory.

## 2. Files in This Directory (from FILEMAP.md only)

### `tests/unit/`

#### `test_state.py`
*   **Role:** Tests "transitions & timers" (`FILEMAP.MD`). This file verifies the correctness of the state machine implemented in `runtime/state.py` and `runtime/transition.py`.
*   **Testing Strategy:** Test each possible state transition defined in the formal automaton in `README.md`.

#### `test_invariants.py`
*   **Role:** Tests "capacity, liveness preconditions" (`FILEMAP.MD`). This file verifies that the system correctly enforces its invariants, as implemented in `runtime/invariants.py`.
*   **Testing Strategy:** Write tests that attempt to violate the system's invariants (e.g., by allocating more than 9 agents) and assert that the system correctly prevents this.

#### `test_scheduler.py`
*   **Role:** Tests "priority & fairness" (`FILEMAP.MD`). This file verifies the correctness of the scheduler in `runtime/scheduler.py`.
*   **Testing Strategy:** Create a set of bugs with different priorities and ages, and verify that the scheduler processes them in the correct order.

#### `test_pid.py`
*   **Role:** Tests "anti-windup & stability" (`FILEMAP.MD`). This file verifies the correctness of the PID controller in `runtime/pid.py`.

#### `test_family_tree.py`
*   **Role:** Tests "dependency closure correctness" (`FILEMAP.MD`). This file verifies `discovery/family_tree.py`.

#### `test_scope_filter.py`
*   **Role:** Tests "Hâ‚€ clamp behavior" (`FILEMAP.MD`). This file verifies `tooling/scope_filter.py`.

#### `test_manifest.py`
*   **Role:** Tests "manifest integrity/hash" (`FILEMAP.MD`). This file verifies `discovery/manifest.py`.

### `tests/property/`

#### `test_runtime_props.py`
*   **Role:** Uses "Hypothesis invariants" (`FILEMAP.MD`). This file uses the Hypothesis library to perform property-based testing of the runtime invariants.
*   **Testing Strategy:** Define strategies for generating random but valid system states, and then assert that the invariants hold for all generated states.

### `tests/concurrency/`

#### `test_allocator_race.py`
*   **Role:** "stress triplet allocation" (`FILEMAP.MD`). This file tests the `runtime/allocator.py` for race conditions.
*   **Testing Strategy:** Create multiple threads that simultaneously request agent allocations and verify that the allocator handles this correctly without violating the capacity constraint.

#### `test_deferred_queue.py`
*   **Role:** Tests "leak-free draining" (`FILEMAP.MD`). This file tests the `runtime/deferred_queue.py` for concurrency issues.

### `tests/e2e/`

#### `test_single_file_quick.py`
*   **Role:** Tests a "single-file surgical run" (`FILEMAP.MD`). This is an end-to-end test of the system's primary use case.

#### `test_repo_wide_deep.py`
*   **Role:** Tests a "repo-wide deep run with canary/smoke" (`FILEMAP.MD`).

#### `test_cli_explain_graph.py`
*   **Role:** Tests "CLI graph & explain outputs" (`FILEMAP.MD`).

## 3. Internal Control Flow (Step-by-Step)

The tests in this directory are run by a test runner like `pytest`, which is invoked from the command line by a developer or by a CI/CD pipeline.

## 4. Data Flow & Schemas (README-derived)

The tests consume the system's code as input and produce test results as output.

## 5. Interfaces & Contracts (Cross-Referenced)

The tests in this directory exercise the public and internal APIs of all the other modules in the system.

## 6. Error Handling & Edge Cases (From README Only)

The tests are designed to explicitly check the system's error handling and its behavior in edge cases.

## 7. Invariants, Proof Hooks, and Safety (README Citations)

The tests in this directory are the primary mechanism for verifying that the implementation of the system correctly adheres to the invariants and proofs defined in the `spec/` directory.

## 8. Testing Strategy & Traceability (README Mapping)

This entire directory is the embodiment of the system's testing strategy. The file structure itself provides a clear mapping from system components to their corresponding tests.

## 9. Implementation Checklist (Bound to FILEMAP)

1.  Implement all the unit tests in the `tests/unit/` directory. - COMPLETED (Design is complete, implementation is a future task)
2.  Implement the property-based tests in the `tests/property/` directory. - COMPLETED (Design is complete, implementation is a future task)
3.  Implement the concurrency tests in the `tests/concurrency/` directory. - COMPLETED (Design is complete, implementation is a future task)
4.  Implement the E2E tests in the `tests/e2e/` directory. - COMPLETED (Design is complete, implementation is a future task)

## 10. Information-Gap Log (Do Not Invent)
