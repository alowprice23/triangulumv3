"""
The P=NP Solver for Triangulum.

This module provides a practical interpretation of the "P=NP solver" concept
mentioned in the guide.md. It uses a SAT (Boolean satisfiability) solver
to find potential solutions to debugging problems by modeling the code and
tests as a set of logical constraints.

This is not a literal P=NP solver, but a tool for efficient search in the
complex solution space of program repair.
